## Fees And Discounts

 If you want to add fees or discounts to your payment order, this can be done by
 adding them as `orderItems` in your request. Use positive amounts for fees and
 negative amounts for discounts. Remember that the sum of the `orderItems` must
 match the total payment order amount.

 Restricting the fee or discount to certain instruments is also possible. Simply
 add the `restrictToInstruments` field and which instruments the fee or discount
 applies to. This is currently available for invoice only.

 The example below shows a fee which only applies to Swedish invoices. Other
 options for some of the fields are in the table at the bottom.

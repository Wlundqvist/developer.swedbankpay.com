## {{ product }} Events

During operation in the {{ product }}, several events can occur. They are
described below.

{% include alert.html type="warning" icon="info" header="Event Overrides"
body="Adding an event handler to one of the following events **overrides** the
default event handler, meaning your custom event handler will have to do what
the default event handler did. If you donâ€™t, the behavior of the event is going
to be undefined. Just adding an event handler for logging purposes is therefore
not possible, the event handler will have to perform some functionality similar
to the event handler you are overriding." %}

object:

{:.code-view-header}

    "id": "/psp/{{ api_resource }}payments/{{ page.payment_id }}",

{:.table .table-striped}
| Field         | Type     | Description                                                    |

| `redirectUrl` | `string` | The URL the user will be redirect to after a cancelled payment. |

## `onPaymentCanceled`

This event triggers when the payer aborts the purchase from the payment menu. As
the Seamless View payment menu doesn't have a cancel button (present in the
Redirect integration), you need to provide this button for the payer at your
end. When the payer presses the cancel button, we recommend sending an API
request aborting the payment so it can't be completed at a later time. When we
receive the request, an abort event will be raised the next time the UI fetches
information from the server. Because of that, you should also refresh after
aborting, as this will trigger the event.

It will be raised with the following event argument object:

{:.code-view-header}
**onPaymentCanceled event object**

```json
{
    "event": "OnPaymentCanceled",
    "paymentOrder": { "id": "/psp/paymentorders/{{ page.payment_id }}" },
    "redirectUrl": "https://example.com/cancelled"
}
```

| :------------ | :------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------  |
| `event`       | `string` | The name of the event raised.                                   |
| `paymentOrder`          | `string` | {% include fields/id.md %}                 |
| `redirectUrl` | `string` | The URL the user will be redirect to after a cancelled payment. |

## `onPaymentCompleted`

This event triggers when the payer successfully completes or cancels the
payment.

Subscribe to this event if actions are needed on you side other than the default
handling of redirecting the payer to your `completeUrl`. Call GET on the
`paymentOrder` to receive the actual payment status, and take appropriate
actions according to it.

It will be raised with the following event argument object:

{:.code-view-header}
**onPaymentCompleted event object**
